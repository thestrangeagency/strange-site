## East Meets West

Based in Berlin and New York, we are optimally positioned to provide world-class services while keeping our overhead low. Our founders hail from the US and have always worked with American companies, so they are well-steeped in American culture and working methodology. At the same time, our European roots help us hire and coordinate the best talent abroad.

## Glocal

Cultural proximity is critical to clear communication and delivering the product youâ€™re after. We provide nearshore development managed by a team of US agency veterans to provide you a local dev shop experience at very competitive rates.

## Small and Agile

While we can scale up to tackle enterprise projects, we keep our team small and agile. We limit hierarchy to keep communication fast and direct, and we rely on rigorous git flow, agile methodology, automated testing, and continuous integration to ensure product development moves quickly and efficiently and remains on target.
